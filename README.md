## Features
1. Web scraping of job postings (Indeed)

2. Data cleaning and preprocessing

3. Extraction of in-demand skills from job titles

4. Salary range analysis

5. Visualization of job trends using Matplotlib

## Technologies Used

Python (Data Processing & Scraping)

Selenium (Web Scraping)

Pandas (Data Analysis)

Matplotlib (Data Visualization)

JSON (Data Storage)
